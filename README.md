## My process

### Built with
Vanilla HTML & CSS.


### What I learned
- Styling placeholder of text input with the `::placeholder` selector : [How To Change Input Placeholder Color](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_placeholder.asp).
- Using the [`:valid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid) and [`:invalid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) pseudo classes on text input elements to style markup based on validation state. 
- I had an issue with the way I defined `box-sizing`. Along with flex-box.


### Questions to community
- As this is the first time that I was using `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo selector, I am wondering if I have done things the proper way or not ? 


### Continued development
- I may dive into a Javascript implementation of the validation feature for better customisation capabilities.
